gpg-clearsign-magic is a simple program deigned to modify interpreted language
programs such as Python or JavaScript or markup like HTML in a fashion that
clearsigns them with your PGP key but does not modify the way they are
interpreted by the machine in any meaningful way. Want to prove it's your
program? Well when it shows up on archive.org signed with your PGP key you can
be sure as sure can be that a person can be convinced it is you who wrote this
code.

So the project exists for that reason and more because it was fun to make.
Please feel free to tidy it up, contibute and add support for more languages.
